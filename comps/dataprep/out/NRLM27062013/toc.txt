1;11. Repayment:  
1;Prompt repayment of the loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks shall take all possible measures, i.e. personal contact, organization of joint recovery camps with District Mission Management Units(DPMUs) / DRDAs to ensure the recovery of loans. Keeping in view, the importance of loan recovery, banks should prepare a list of defaulters under NRLM every month and furnish the list in the BLBC, DLCC meetings. This would ensure that NRLM staff at the district/ block level will assist the bankers in initiating the repayment.
